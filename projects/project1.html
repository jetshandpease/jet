  <h1>Cool Neutrino Project</h1>
  <p>This is a project I have been working on for some time. It involves sending neutrinos through sections of the earth in high quantity and detecting them on the other side to shave milliseconds off of intermarket communications. It is likely to involve a nuclear reactor on the send-side and a massive pool of water or mineral oil or liquid argon on the receive side. There are many avenues which still need to be developed before this project is considered anywhere near theoretically complete - narrowing the beam of produced neutrinos enough to cross over a region the size of the observer some many thousands of kilometres away is not easy. Firing up and down (or alternatively focusing or angling the neutrinos) with sub millisecond precision is not easy. Sending information at a high enough fidelity that this is an economically net positive venture is not easy. But it would be cool.</p>
