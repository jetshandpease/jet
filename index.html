    <h1>Hello, I'm Jet Shand-Pease.</h1>
    <p>I’m a recent Mathematics graduate (BSc) from the University of Auckland - a Top 40 global university and my home until I graduated. I’ve recently moved to London (holding British citizenship) and I’m incredibly keen to start my career in quantitative trading or research.


I’m eager to find any opportunity - whether that’s a graduate position, internship, or even unpaid work experience - that would allow me to gain hands-on exposure and build my career from the ground up. I’m more than willing to start anywhere - even the mailroom - if it helps me get a foot in the door and learn from the best.


Since graduating, I’ve been self-studying Python, financial mathematics, and quantitative trading strategies through industry-recommended resources. Without the usual careers pipelines from a UK university, I’m proactively doing everything I can to upskill and position myself for success.</p>
